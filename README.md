# Snake Game

This repository contains a simple web-based snake game written in JavaScript.

## Running

To launch the game locally you can start a small Python server and then open the page in a browser:

```bash
python3 server.py
```

Once the server is running navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

Use the arrow keys to move the snake. When it reaches an edge it reappears on
the opposite side. The game ends only if the snake collides with itself or
grows to fill the entire grid.
